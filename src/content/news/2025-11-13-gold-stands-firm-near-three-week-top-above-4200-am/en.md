Gold (XAU/USD) has reached a three-week high, trading above $4,200, as market sentiment shifts towards expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. This surge in the precious metal reflects a broader trend, with traders increasingly positioning themselves for potential monetary easing, which typically boosts demand for gold as a non-yielding asset.

The positive momentum in gold prices is further supported by a weakening U.S. dollar, which influences the exchange rate dynamics within the forex market. As investors reassess their strategies in light of possible Fed actions, the bullish outlook for gold suggests that it may continue to gain traction, attracting more trading activity in the coming sessions.
