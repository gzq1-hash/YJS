The EUR/JPY currency pair continues its upward trajectory, reaching a fresh record high just below the 180.00 level during the Asian trading session on Friday. This marks the sixth consecutive day of gains for the pair, contributing to an impressive seven days of positive movement in the last eight sessions. 

This rally comes as traders await key Eurozone GDP data, which could further influence the exchange rate. The sustained bullish momentum reflects strong market sentiment and may indicate increasing demand for the euro against the yen, influenced by broader economic factors in the region. As the pair approaches this psychological threshold, market participants are keenly observing for any potential breakout or correction.
