The US Dollar faced renewed pressure on Friday, November 14, as concerns about economic growth resurfaced, impacting its performance across major currency pairs. The USD fell against the Euro, with the EUR/USD exchange rate climbing to 1.0850, a gain of 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dollar weakened against the Japanese Yen, as USD/JPY slipped to 110.25, reflecting a broader trend of risk aversion in the markets.

Traders are closely monitoring key economic indicators that may signal a slowdown, contributing to the Dollar's struggles. The market sentiment is increasingly cautious, leading to volatility in forex trading as investors reassess their positions amid uncertainty. As growth concerns linger, the implications for USD could lead to further declines if economic data continues to disappoint.
