EUR/CAD has extended its upward momentum for the fourth consecutive session, trading around 1.6230 during Friday's Asian hours. The currency pair's rise is primarily driven by a cautious sentiment regarding the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy outlook, which has bolstered the Euro (EUR) against the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

As the ECB signals a more reserved approach to interest rates, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the Eurozone economy. This cautious stance has provided support for the Euro, helping the EUR/CAD pair near the 1.6250 mark. Market participants will likely remain attentive to further developments from the ECB, as any shifts in policy could significantly influence the exchange rate dynamics in the coming sessions.
