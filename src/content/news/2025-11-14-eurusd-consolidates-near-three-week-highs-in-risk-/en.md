EUR/USD is consolidating near its three-week highs, currently trading at 1.1630. The currency pair is just shy of the recent peak of 1.1655 reached on Thursday, reflecting a stable performance in a risk-off market environment. As the week comes to a close, the euro is poised to secure a gain of approximately 0.6% against the US dollar.

Market sentiment has shifted, contributing to the euro's strength amid uncertainties surrounding global economic conditions. Traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact the USD, as fluctuations in the exchange rate remain sensitive to both geopolitical events and economic indicators. With this upward trend, the EUR/USD pair's movements could influence further trading strategies as the market prepares for the upcoming week.
