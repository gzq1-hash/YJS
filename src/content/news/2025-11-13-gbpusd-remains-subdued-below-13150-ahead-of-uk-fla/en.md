GBP/USD continues to languish below the 1.3150 mark, trading around 1.3120 during the Asian session on Thursday. This subdued performance marks the third consecutive trading day of limited movement for the currency pair, as traders remain cautious ahead of the highly anticipated UK flash Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the third quarter, set to be released later today.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming GDP figures, which could significantly impact the exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected result may bolster the British pound against the USD, while disappointing data could exacerbate the current downward pressure on the currency pair. As the trading day unfolds, fluctuations around 1.3120 could signal traders' sentiment heading into the announcement, with the potential for heightened volatility in the GBP/USD exchange rate.
