The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle during Thursday's Asian session, remaining under pressure amid ongoing doubts regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy direction. Despite Governor Kazuo Ueda's remarks indicating a gradual acceleration of underlying inflation towards the 2% target, the Yen's exchange rate shows little reaction, highlighting its vulnerability in the current market environment.

As traders evaluate the implications of the BoJ's stance, the USD/JPY pair trades near key technical levels, reflecting investor sentiment. The Yen's persistent weakness may encourage traders to look for opportunities in other currency pairs, potentially boosting demand for the US dollar and the euro. With the market's focus on inflation and monetary policy, the outlook for the JPY remains uncertain, suggesting ongoing volatility in forex trading activities.
