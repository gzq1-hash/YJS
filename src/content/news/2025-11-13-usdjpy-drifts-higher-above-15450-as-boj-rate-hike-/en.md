The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing upward momentum, trading above 154.50 as it reaches a peak of 154.75 during the early Asian session on Thursday. This marks the highest exchange rate for the pair since February, indicating a renewed interest among buyers in the market.

The recent movement in USD/JPY comes amid fading expectations for a rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which has influenced trading dynamics. As traders reassess their positions, the strength of the US dollar continues to attract attention, potentially setting the stage for further price fluctuations in the coming sessions.
