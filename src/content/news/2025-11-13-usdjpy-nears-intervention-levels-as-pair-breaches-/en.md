USD/JPY surged in a risk-on environment, briefly crossing the critical 155.0 level, raising concerns about potential intervention by authorities. As traders respond to favorable market conditions, this upward movement in the currency pair reflects a growing appetite for riskier assets, contributing to the dollar's strength against the yen.
