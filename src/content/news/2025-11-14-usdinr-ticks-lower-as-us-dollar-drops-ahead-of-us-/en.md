The USD/INR currency pair opened lower on Friday as the Indian Rupee (INR) gained traction against the US Dollar (USD), with the exchange rate dipping to around 88.85. This decline in USD is attributed to market anticipation of upcoming US economic data releases, which have created a bearish sentiment among traders.

As the US Dollar continues to weaken, the movement in the USD/INR pair reflects broader market dynamics. The potential implications of these economic indicators may further impact trading strategies, influencing how investors position themselves in this key currency pair. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments as they unfold.
