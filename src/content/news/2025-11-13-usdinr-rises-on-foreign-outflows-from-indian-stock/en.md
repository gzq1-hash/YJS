The USD/INR currency pair opened higher on Thursday as the Indian Rupee (INR) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) amid significant foreign outflows from the Indian stock market. The exchange rate saw the INR tick lower, reflecting ongoing concerns over global market dynamics and investor sentiment. This movement indicates a cautious trading environment as foreign investors pull back, impacting the rupee's stability.

Market analysts attribute the rupee's decline to heightened bets on a dovish stance from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Expectations of reduced interest rates could further pressure the currency pair, creating a ripple effect in the forex market. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the USD/INR rate could influence broader trading strategies and decisions in the region.
