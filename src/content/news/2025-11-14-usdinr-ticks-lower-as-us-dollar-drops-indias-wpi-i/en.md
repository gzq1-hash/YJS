The Indian Rupee (INR) gained ground against the US Dollar (USD) at the start of trading on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair slipping to around 88.85. This decline reflects a broader weakening of the US Dollar in the forex market, which has been influenced by various macroeconomic factors.

Additionally, India's wholesale price index (WPI) inflation showed a notable decrease of 1.21%, further impacting market sentiment. The drop in inflation rates may bolster the INR, as it suggests a more stable economic environment, potentially attracting more investors to the Indian market. As traders monitor these developments, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and INR remain a focal point for market participants.
