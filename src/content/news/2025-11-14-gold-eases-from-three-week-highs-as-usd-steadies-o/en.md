Gold (XAU/USD) faced a downturn on Friday, retreating from three-week highs as traders reacted to a steadier U.S. dollar amid a cautious Federal Reserve outlook. Currently, XAU/USD is trading around $4,100, reflecting a nearly 1.5% decline after dipping to $4,032 earlier in the session. This pullback highlights the struggle of bulls to maintain momentum in a mixed market environment.

The recent fluctuations in gold prices are largely influenced by the USD's performance, as investor sentiment shifts in response to economic indicators and Fed policy signals. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that further developments in monetary policy could continue to sway gold trading, impacting both bullish and bearish positions in the coming weeks. As market participants remain vigilant, the interplay between gold and the U.S. dollar will be crucial in shaping future price movements.
