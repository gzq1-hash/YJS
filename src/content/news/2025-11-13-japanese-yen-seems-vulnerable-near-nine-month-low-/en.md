The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle in forex markets, trading near a nine-month low against the US Dollar (USD). As uncertainty looms over the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy, the JPY/USD exchange rate remains vulnerable, reflecting traders' concerns about potential shifts in the BoJ's stance. The yen's weakness has been pronounced, with recent trading sessions highlighting a lack of confidence.

As the European session approaches, the JPY is poised for further pressure, impacted by ongoing speculation regarding the BoJ's future actions. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and any signals from the BoJ that could provide clarity. With the JPY hovering at critical support levels, a breakdown could lead to increased volatility, influencing broader market sentiment and impacting other currency pairs such as EUR/USD.
