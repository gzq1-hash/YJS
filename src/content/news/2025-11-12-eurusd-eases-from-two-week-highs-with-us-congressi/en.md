The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing slight declines on Wednesday, retreating from two-week highs as the exchange rate hovers around 1.1670. This comes after the pair surged above 1.1600 on Tuesday, driven by market optimism. Traders are now closely watching the upcoming US congressional vote, which is expected to influence the dollar's strength and overall market sentiment.

As the market digests the potential implications of the congressional vote, the fluctuations in the USD are likely to impact the EUR/USD trading dynamics. A successful vote could bolster the dollar and further press the exchange rate downward, while any setbacks may provide support for the euro. Investors remain cautious as they navigate through this pivotal political landscape.
