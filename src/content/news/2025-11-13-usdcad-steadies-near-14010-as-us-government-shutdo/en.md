USD/CAD has steadied around the 1.4010 level, interrupting its four-day losing streak as trading continues into Thursday's Asian session. The currency pair's flat performance suggests a possible rebound, particularly as the US Dollar (USD) is expected to strengthen further following the resolution of the US government shutdown, which has improved market sentiment.

As traders assess the implications of the shutdown's end, the USD may gain traction against the Canadian Dollar (CAD). Increased confidence in the US economy could drive the exchange rate higher, making USD/CAD a pair to watch as the market reacts to new economic developments.
