The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is currently hovering around the 1.40 mark against the US Dollar (USD), showing a slight upward movement despite the broader weakening of the USD. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the CAD has struggled to break decisively below this crucial figure, indicating persistent resistance at this level.

As market participants continue to monitor the exchange rate, the inability of the CAD to secure a clear push under 1.40 may suggest underlying strength in the Canadian currency. Traders will be watching closely for any developments that could catalyze a more significant movement in the CAD, particularly in the context of ongoing fluctuations in USD and other currency pairs, such as EUR/CAD.
