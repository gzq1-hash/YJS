Market-based inflation expectations have been a focal point for traders, particularly concerning the USD's performance against the EUR. Over the summer, short-term expectations remained elevated, prompting speculation about future Federal Reserve policy adjustments. As tariffs continue to affect trade dynamics, the USD's purchasing power is under scrutiny, with the exchange rate reflecting these pressures.

Recent movements in the EUR/USD pair highlight a tug-of-war between inflation concerns and economic resilience. Analysts suggest that a decline in inflation expectations could bolster the USD, potentially leading to a stronger exchange rate. However, with tariffs still looming, the implications for trade and consumer prices will be critical for shaping market sentiment and trading strategies in the coming weeks.
