The recent conclusion of the US government shutdown has had a muted impact on foreign exchange markets, with volatility remaining subdued. Traders are hesitant as the anticipated October economic data, including crucial payroll figures and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports, are not expected to surface in the near term. This uncertainty has led to a cautious approach in trading activities, particularly concerning the USD.

As the market digests the implications of the shutdown's end, currency pairs like EUR/USD are experiencing limited movement, with the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels. Investors are closely monitoring the upcoming data releases to gauge potential shifts in the USD's strength against major currencies.
