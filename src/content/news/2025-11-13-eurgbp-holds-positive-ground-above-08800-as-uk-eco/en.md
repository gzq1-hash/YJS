The EUR/GBP currency pair has strengthened to approximately 0.8835 in early European trading on Thursday, buoyed by a downturn in the UK economy. The latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a sluggish growth rate of just 0.1% for the third quarter, prompting a decline in the Pound Sterling against the Euro. 

This economic slowdown has led traders to reassess their positions, resulting in increased buying pressure on the Euro. As the exchange rate remains firmly above the 0.8800 level, market participants are closely monitoring further economic indicators from the UK, as any additional weakness could push the EUR/GBP pair even higher in the coming sessions.
