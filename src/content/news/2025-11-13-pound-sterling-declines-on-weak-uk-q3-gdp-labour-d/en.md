The Pound Sterling (GBP) has weakened against its major counterparts following disappointing preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the UK in the third quarter. The exchange rate has slipped to 1.2150 against the US Dollar (USD) and 1.1140 against the Euro (EUR), reflecting growing economic concerns that have dampened investor sentiment towards the UK economy.

Analysts suggest that the underwhelming GDP figures, coupled with lackluster labor data, could lead to a reassessment of the Bank of England's monetary policy stance. As trading continues, the GBP may face further pressure, with technical levels indicating potential support at 1.2100 against the USD. Market participants are closely monitoring developments, as any continued decline could signal broader economic challenges for the region.
