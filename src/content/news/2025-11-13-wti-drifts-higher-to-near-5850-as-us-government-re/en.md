West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has seen a modest uptick, trading around $58.50 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This increase comes on the heels of US President Donald Trump's signing of a bill to reopen the government, providing a sense of stability in the market. As the USD gains traction, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the energy sector, particularly in relation to the ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The reopening of the US government is expected to influence the exchange rates of various currency pairs, including the USD/EUR. With the market reacting positively, WTI's rise could signal a shift in investor sentiment, potentially impacting oil demand forecasts. As traders weigh the effects of this political development, the market's focus will be on both economic data releases and further policy decisions that could shape the trading landscape in the coming weeks.
