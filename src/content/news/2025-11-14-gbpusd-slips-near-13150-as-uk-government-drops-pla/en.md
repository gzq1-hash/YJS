GBP/USD has retraced its recent gains, trading at approximately 1.3150 during the Asian session on Friday. The decline in the currency pair follows the UK government's decision to abandon plans for tax rate increases, raising concerns about fiscal discipline and political stability. As the Pound Sterling weakens, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the UK economy.

Amid these developments, the exchange rate reflects heightened uncertainty in the market. The drop in GBP has led to a cautious sentiment among investors, especially as they assess potential impacts on future monetary policy decisions. With the USD remaining strong, the market may see continued volatility in the GBP/USD currency pair as traders react to evolving economic indicators and political developments.
