Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly addressed inflation trends during a speech in Dublin, noting that while inflation is decreasing, it remains persistently high. This commentary comes as traders analyze the USD, particularly against the EUR, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.10. Market participants are weighing Daly’s insights on monetary policy, which could influence future trading strategies.

The Fed's stance on inflation will likely impact the USD's strength moving forward. With the current inflation rate showing signs of moderation but still viewed as stubborn, the market anticipates potential shifts in interest rates. As a result, forex traders are closely monitoring any developments that may affect the USD's performance versus other currencies, particularly in light of ongoing global economic uncertainties.
