Gold (XAU/USD) continued its upward trajectory, marking the fourth consecutive day of gains and reaching a fresh three-week high during the early European session on Thursday. This positive momentum comes as traders react to shifting economic indicators, reflecting a growing demand for safe-haven assets amidst ongoing market uncertainties. The current exchange rate positions gold for potential further appreciation as investor sentiment remains cautious.

The recent surge in gold prices highlights a broader market trend where the yellow metal often serves as a hedge against volatility in the USD and other currency pairs. As the price of gold climbs, it underscores the ongoing dynamics in forex trading, with investors closely monitoring fluctuations in global economic conditions that impact both the EUR and USD. With gold consolidating gains, traders are keenly observing technical levels for future trading strategies.
