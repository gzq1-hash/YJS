The US Dollar (USD) continued its downward trajectory on Thursday, hitting fresh monthly lows against major currencies. As investors reacted to the recent resolution of the longest US government shutdown in history, the USD's exchange rate was pressured, resulting in increased volatility in the forex market. Current trading patterns show mixed expectations on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in December, with market sentiment remaining divided.

In contrast, attention turned to the eurozone as GDP figures took center stage, influencing the EUR/USD currency pair. With traders assessing the implications of these economic indicators, any significant movement in the exchange rate could signal shifts in monetary policy outlooks for both the Euro and the Dollar. As the market braces for further data from the US, the dynamics between the USD and EUR will be critical in shaping trading strategies moving forward.
