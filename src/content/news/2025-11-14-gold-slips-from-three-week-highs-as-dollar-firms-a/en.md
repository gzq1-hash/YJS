Gold (XAU/USD) has retreated from its recent highs as buying momentum wanes amid a stronger US dollar and cautious sentiments from the Federal Reserve. Currently trading around $4,133, gold saw a peak at $4,245 on Thursday, its highest level in over three weeks. This decline reflects a broader trend in the market, where mixed signals influence trading decisions.

The strengthening of the USD has played a significant role in gold's downtrend, impacting the exchange rate dynamics within the forex market. As traders digest the Fed's recent comments, uncertainty continues to cast a shadow over precious metals, prompting bulls to reassess their positions. With the current market fluctuations, investors will be closely monitoring future developments to gauge potential recovery or further declines in the XAU/USD pair.
