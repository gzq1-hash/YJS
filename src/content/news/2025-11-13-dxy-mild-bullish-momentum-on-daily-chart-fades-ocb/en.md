The US Dollar (USD) experienced mixed trading overnight, showing signs of mild bullish momentum that has since faded. According to OCBC's FX analysts Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, the Dollar Index (DXY) was last recorded at 99.32. While the USD weakened against major currencies, it found modest strength against several Asian currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen (JPY).

This fluctuation in the USD's value reflects broader market dynamics and investor sentiment, with the currency pair's performance impacting exchange rates globally. The slight recovery against Asian currencies suggests a cautious optimism within the market, yet the overall softness against major forex players could indicate underlying volatility. Traders will be closely monitoring these trends as they develop, assessing potential implications for future USD movements.
