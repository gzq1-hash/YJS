GBP/JPY remains stable above the 203.00 mark, holding close to a two-week high reached earlier at approximately 203.55-203.60. During the Asian trading session on Thursday, the currency pair edged lower but managed to recover slightly from daily lows below 203.00, indicating resilient buying pressure despite a lack of aggressive follow-through selling.

As traders await a significant data release from the UK, the stability in the GBP/JPY exchange rate suggests cautious optimism in the market. The upcoming economic data could influence future price movements, with potential implications for both the British pound and Japanese yen. Market participants will be closely watching for any developments that may affect trading sentiment in this currency pair.
