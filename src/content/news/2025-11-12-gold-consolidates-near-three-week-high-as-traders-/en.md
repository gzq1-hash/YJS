Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady near a three-week high as market participants take a cautious stance ahead of a pivotal U.S. congressional vote aimed at resolving the ongoing government shutdown. Currently, the precious metal is trading just below $1,940 per ounce, reflecting a consolidation of recent gains as traders assess the potential impact of the vote on the broader market.

The anticipation surrounding the funding vote is influencing trading behavior, with investors closely monitoring the developments for indications on the future strength of the U.S. dollar (USD). A successful resolution could bolster the USD, potentially weighing on gold prices, while continued uncertainty may keep demand for the safe-haven asset elevated as market sentiment remains fragile. As the vote approaches, fluctuations in the exchange rate between gold and USD are expected, highlighting the interplay between fiscal policy and commodity trading.
