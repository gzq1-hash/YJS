The US Dollar Index (DXY) experienced modest losses, trading around 99.15 during the Asian session on Friday, as speculation regarding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts gained traction. This decline brings the index closer to the critical psychological level of 99.00, reflecting market uncertainty about the future direction of USD exchange rates against a basket of six major currencies.

The emerging doubts about the Fed's tightening stance have influenced trading sentiment, particularly affecting pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY. As investors reassess their positions, volatility may increase, prompting traders to watch the index closely for further developments. The shift in expectations could lead to significant implications for USD strength in the coming days.
