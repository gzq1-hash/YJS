Gold (XAU/USD) is struggling to maintain its position above the significant $4,200 level as it gives up a considerable portion of its modest intraday gains. As the European session approaches on Friday, the reduced expectations for a December rate cut by the Federal Reserve have influenced market sentiment, leading to a pullback in the precious metal.

Traders are closely monitoring developments related to the USD, as shifts in monetary policy outlook can directly impact trading in gold. The current exchange rate reflects a market grappling with uncertainty, highlighting the complex interplay between interest rates and safe-haven assets such as gold. With the focus now shifting towards upcoming economic indicators, further volatility in this currency pair is anticipated.
