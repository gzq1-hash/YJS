The Japanese Yen (JPY) has gained ground against a weakening US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Friday, although it remains near a nine-month low. The USD/JPY exchange rate reflects this movement, with the Yen's modest strength unable to significantly alter the market's overall bearish sentiment towards the Dollar.

Despite the Yen's uptick, analysts suggest that its upside potential may be limited in the near term. With the USD under pressure from various economic factors, including concerns over the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, traders are cautious. The JPY may see further volatility as market participants assess the broader implications for currency pairs, particularly with the Euro (EUR) also experiencing fluctuations against the Dollar.
