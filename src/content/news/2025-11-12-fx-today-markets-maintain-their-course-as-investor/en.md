The US Dollar (USD) continues to face downward pressure as market sentiment shifts towards a risk-on approach. Investors are closely monitoring developments in Washington, with a crucial vote on short-term government funding expected in the House of Representatives. This anticipation is influencing trading dynamics across major currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which exhibits a robust exchange rate as demand for the euro rises.

As the vote looms, traders are adjusting their positions, reflecting a cautious optimism in the market. The uncertainty surrounding the US government's funding could lead to increased volatility in the coming days. Consequently, the USD is likely to remain sensitive to both domestic policy outcomes and broader market trends as investors seek clarity on fiscal stability and economic direction.
