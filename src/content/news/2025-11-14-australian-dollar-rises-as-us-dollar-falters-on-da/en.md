The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, recovering from previous losses as the AUD/USD exchange rate moved higher. This upward momentum was primarily driven by the release of China's Industrial Production and Retail Sales figures for October, which exceeded market expectations and bolstered demand for the Australian currency.

As traders reacted to the positive economic data from China, the AUD gained traction, positioning itself favorably against the USD. This shift in the currency pair reflects growing market confidence in Australia's economic prospects, potentially influencing future trading strategies as investors monitor ongoing developments in global trade and economic indicators.
