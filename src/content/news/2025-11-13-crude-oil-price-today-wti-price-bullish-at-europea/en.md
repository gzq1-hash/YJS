West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices showed notable bullish momentum early in the European trading session on Thursday, rising to $58.46 per barrel from Wednesday's close of $58.43. This increase reflects ongoing market optimism, potentially driven by supply constraints and geopolitical tensions affecting oil production.

Similarly, Brent crude prices also edged higher, trading at $62.54, up from the previous day's $62.52. This upward trend in both WTI and Brent prices may influence currency pairs related to oil-exporting nations, impacting the USD and EUR exchange rates as traders assess the implications for global inflation and economic recovery.
