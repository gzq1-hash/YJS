The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure, trading near a nine-month low against the U.S. Dollar (USD). The currency pair recently hit a low of 149.30 as uncertainty looms over potential interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments on inflation suggest a gradual rise towards the 2% target, but traders remain cautious about any imminent monetary policy shifts.

This sustained weakness in the JPY reflects broader market dynamics, as the USD continues to benefit from a robust economic outlook and expectations of further rate increases from the Federal Reserve. As the exchange rate fluctuates, investors are closely monitoring BoJ signals to gauge future trading strategies. The interplay between the JPY and USD is critical for forex markets, particularly as traders navigate the implications of potential changes in Japan's economic policy.
