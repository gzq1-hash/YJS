The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading positively around 99.50 during Thursday’s Asian session, buoyed by the resolution of a record-long government shutdown. This strengthening reflects increased investor confidence and a favorable outlook for the USD against a basket of six major currencies. The end of political uncertainty has prompted a rise in trading activity as market participants adjust their positions.

As the DXY approaches the 99.50 mark, the implications for other currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, are significant. Traders are closely monitoring exchange rates, anticipating potential shifts in monetary policy and interest rates. The recent stability in the dollar may lead to further fluctuations in the forex market as investors reassess their strategies in response to the evolving economic landscape.
