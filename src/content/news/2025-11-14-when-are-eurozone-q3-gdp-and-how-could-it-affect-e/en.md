Eurostat is scheduled to unveil the preliminary Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the Eurozone at 10:00 GMT on Friday. This release could significantly influence the EUR/USD exchange rate, as traders closely monitor economic indicators to gauge the region's economic health. A stronger-than-expected GDP figure may bolster the euro, potentially pushing the currency pair above key resistance levels.

Conversely, if the data disappoints, the euro may weaken against the USD, leading to increased selling pressure on EUR/USD. Market participants will be looking for any signs of economic recovery or contraction within the Eurozone, which could lead to volatility in trading. As the exchange rate reacts to the news, traders should remain vigilant for shifts that could impact their positions in this major currency pair.
