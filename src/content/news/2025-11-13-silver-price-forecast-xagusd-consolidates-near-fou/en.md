Silver (XAG/USD) is currently consolidating near a four-week high, trading just below the mid-$53.00s as it stabilizes after significant gains over the past four days. During the Asian session on Thursday, the currency pair has been oscillating within a tight range, reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

The recent upward movement in silver prices can be attributed to a combination of factors, including shifts in investor sentiment and fluctuations in the USD exchange rate. As traders assess the implications of economic indicators globally, silver's resilience may indicate continued interest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation and market volatility. With the trading activity concentrated around the recent highs, market participants are closely monitoring potential breakout levels.
