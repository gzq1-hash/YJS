USD/JPY is trading at approximately 154.85, reflecting a 0.50% increase on Wednesday. The yen has weakened, influenced by comments from Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, which have sparked renewed speculation about a potential easing of fiscal policy. This dovish sentiment from the government is further compounded by the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on future interest rate hikes.

Market participants are also buoyed by optimism surrounding a potential resolution to the looming US government shutdown. As the dollar strengthens against the yen, traders are keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments and monetary policy signals that could impact the exchange rate of this key currency pair in the coming days.
