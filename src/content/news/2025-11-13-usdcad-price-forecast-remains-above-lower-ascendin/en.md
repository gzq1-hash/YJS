USD/CAD has seen a rebound after four consecutive days of losses, currently trading at approximately 1.4010 during the Asian session on Friday. This upward movement suggests a bullish momentum, as the currency pair continues to operate within an ascending channel pattern. The key support level to watch is near the 1.4000 mark, which has proven to be a critical boundary.

Technical analysis indicates that the prevailing bullish bias could signal further gains for the USD/CAD exchange rate if it maintains its position above this lower channel boundary. As traders monitor market movements, any significant break below the 1.4000 level may prompt a reevaluation of the current bullish outlook, while sustained strength could encourage further upward momentum in the currency pair.
