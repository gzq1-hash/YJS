Eurostat will release the preliminary Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the Eurozone at 10:00 GMT on Friday, a key event that could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. Market analysts are closely watching this report, as it provides insights into the region's economic performance and may impact trading strategies for the currency pair.

Currently, the EUR/USD is experiencing fluctuations as traders brace for the GDP announcement. A stronger-than-expected growth figure could bolster the euro against the dollar, pushing the exchange rate higher. Conversely, disappointing data might lead to a sell-off in EUR, potentially driving the pair downwards. Investors are advised to monitor these developments closely, as they could significantly affect market sentiment and trading positions.
