The Indian Rupee (INR) opened higher against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading down to approximately 88.85. This movement reflects a broader trend as the US Dollar continues to weaken, prompting traders to exercise caution ahead of impending economic data releases from the US.

Market participants are closely monitoring these upcoming data points, which could significantly impact the exchange rate. As the USD struggles, the INR's resilience may suggest a potential for further gains, depending on the outcomes of the economic reports. This dynamic highlights the interplay between US economic indicators and currency movements in the forex market.
